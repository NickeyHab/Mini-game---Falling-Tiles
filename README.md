# Mini-game---Falling-Tiles

Final game dev course game. Create your own minigame. This is a spleef type of game where tiles fall once you step on them.

Learned:
* using IEnumerator to make tiles fall and how to have them fade while falling.
* made a segmented jump. To have a specific type of jump.
* movement relative to the camera.

Work in progress:
* split screen local co-op. Was able to get player 2 in the game but was not able to have it controlled on the same keyboard as player 1.
